# Deep-Quantum-RL

DQN algorithm with regular and Priority Experience Replay. Implemented with Torch (classical) and Pennylane (quantum).

Utilizes Quantum Reuploading Circuits found in [PÃ©rez-Salinas et al.](https://quantum-journal.org/papers/q-2020-02-06-226/) and 
[Skolik et al.](https://quantum-journal.org/papers/q-2022-05-24-720/).

# How to use

Files are in progress. Use DQN_torch_notebook.ipynb to run experiments. If you want to record results, you will need Weights and Bias account. Recommend running in colab.
